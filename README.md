# üìù CRAFT-Sentence-Extractor: Document Sentence Extraction with CRAFT and Transformers

![Book Page Detection](./sample_image_det.png)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a tool designed to extract sentences from documents by leveraging the **CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection)** deep learning model. While CRAFT is a proven approach for word detection in OCR, it is actually doesn't provide line extraction and because of its nature it lacks overall document layout understanding. This provides an opportunity to expand its capabilities using modern Transformer models.

The goal of this project is to **enhance document analysis by creating a combined approach** that utilizes CRAFT for word-level detection and Transformers for understanding the document layout. However, this repository serve as the first part of that effort, in which its main purpose is to algorithmically help create a syntentic dataset that enable us to extract lines of texts instead of single words. This will ultimately lead to a more accurate and reliable sentence extraction pipeline.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to address key challenges in the sentence extraction task using existing OCR technologies like CRAFT, which, while effective for word detection, it doesn't provide the understanding of document structure or sentence formation. This repository explores the **next phase of evolution in OCR tasks** by combining traditional models with Transformers for better contextual and layout comprehension.

This project was created as a submission for the **Harvard CS50 curriculum**, contributing towards the completion of the certificate.

## Strategy

The current approach follows a **two-stage pipeline**:

1. **Word Detection using CRAFT**: CRAFT detects character regions and extracts word bounding boxes.
2. **Sentence Grouping with Layout Awareness**: Words are then grouped into sentences based on document layout heuristics such as spatial relationships between words.

While effective, this approach has limitations:

- **Column Detection Sensitivity**: The grouping logic is sensitive to hyperparameters like column separation. Adjusting these parameters manually can affect detection accuracy, particularly for multi-column documents.
- **Mixed Orientation Text**: Our logic struggles with detecting text that mixes orientations. For example, documents with both horizontal and vertical text may yield incorrect results, as the algorithm expects uniform text orientation.
- **Transformer-Based Single-Pass Approach** *(Future Plan)*: To overcome these limitations, this repository lays the groundwork for a **single-pass Transformer-based approach**. The goal is to incorporate document layout understanding, such as sentence or paragraph grouping, by training a model that pairs with CRAFT.

## Roadmap and Future Plans

This project is part of a larger plan to develop a more **intelligent document understanding pipeline**. The next steps will involve:

- **Training a custom model** that jointly utilizes CRAFT for word detection and a **Transformer-based approach** for document layout understanding.
- Creating a **synthetic dataset** to facilitate training of the combined model.
- Moving towards a **single-pass extraction process** that natively understands the relationship between text regions, paragraphs, columns, and other document layout elements.

The ultimate goal is to develop a robust system that can **handle complex document layouts**, including multiple columns, mixed text orientations, and different fonts or styles.
